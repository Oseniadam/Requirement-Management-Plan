Managing requirements is a key tool for business and project success. This paper explains some of the concepts of requirements management and introduces a number of techniques that can be applied. Through these approaches, you can help ensure that the final delivery from a project or initiative aligns with the initial strategic intent. In other words, you can deliver exactly what the stakeholders expect and what the business needs.

# What is a Requirement?
Requirements exist within all organizations; all organizations exist to delivery products and/or services to customers, which are always delivered through business processes that are decomposed into individual requirements. Requirements are simply a capability needed by a stakeholder (person) to deliver a product and/or service.

# What is Requirements Management?
Requirements Management is an iterative set of activities that help ensure that elicitation, documentation, refinement, and changes of requirements is adequately dealt with during a lifecycle, with a view toward satisfying the overall mission or need in a quality manner and to the customers’ satisfaction.

Whether part of a project management plan or standalone, a Requirements Management Plan (RMP) describes the requirements artifacts, requirement types (including attributes), the requirements management process, and the metrics and tools to be used for measuring, reporting, and controlling changes to the requirements.

# Why Manage Requirements?
Studies have shown that requirements management improves all major aspects of organizational strategy (portfolio, programs, and projects) or operations management (day-to-day business) by:

Reducing cost
Improvings quality
Decreasing time taken
Decreasings risks
Enabling effective scope management

In 2009, IAG Consulting conducted a Business Analysis Benchmark survey, 68% of companies surveyed used poor requirements practices and reported that while having estimated a project at US$3 million, it will be on budget less than 20% of the time. On average, these companies with poor requirements practices will pay US$5.87 million per project, a significant increase over estimation.

According to the 2004 CHAOS Report, three of the top five reasons projects fail are related to requirements:

Users are not involved enough in requirements definition
Requirements are incomplete or don't meet acceptance criteria
Requirements are constantly changing, and these changes are not managed effectively.
The CHAOS Summary (2009) reported that 44% were challenged (late, over budget, and/or with less than the required features and functions); and 24% failed (cancelled prior to completion or delivered and never used).

Where are Requirements Managed in an Organization?
Organizations exist to deliver products and/or services, which are delivered through business processes that are decomposed into requirements. Requirements should be managed in organizational strategy (portfolio, programs, and projects) or operations management (day-to-day business). Often, requirements management is lacking in strategic planning, portfolios, and day-to-day business initiatives (often referred to as continuous improvement).

Strategic Planning (strategy to execution) –business requirements (outcomes and benefits) are defined and quantified
Portfolio –business requirements are used to link the strategy to the portfolio of change
Program –business requirements are used to define the program scope and success criteria

Project –business and stakeholder requirements are used to define the project scope and success criteria. Solution –nonfunctional and transition requirements are used to build and implement a solution

Continuous Improvement (day-to-day business) – business requirements and stakeholder requirements are used to define the continuous improvement, scope, and success criteria. 

The Requirements Management Plan (RMP)
RMP Contents
The contents of a typical RMP contain the following sections:

Stakeholder roles and responsibilities
Requirements management process (elicited, analyzed, documented, and managed)
Requirements type definition
Requirements type/artifact mapping
Naming and numbering convention
Requirements prioritization
Requirements traceability
Requirements versioning
Requirements baseline (requirements change control)
Communication strategy for requirement changes
Requirements management tools
Stakeholder Roles and Responsibilities

# Who creates the RMP?
Business Analysts with input from the project manager

# Who approves/endorses RMP?
Leaders from each Software Delivery Lifecycle SDLC team

# Who participates in the RM process?
Business subject matter expert – source of project/product requirements

Business analyst – gathers, analyzes, and documents requirements

Designer – uses requirements to design solutions

Developer – develops solutions to requirements

Tester – verifies the solution and satisfies the requirements

Project manager – reports project status based on requirement metrics

Change management analyst – determines organizational change due to requirements

# Who maintains the RMP?
Business Analysts (BA)
Who is involved in a requirements management plan? As a BA, you must work fairly closely with the project manager in creating a requirements management plan. The project manager will have project planning requirements that he/she needs to satisfy, so the BA needs to be aware of that and needs to help ensure the requirements management plan works well for the project.

In some cases, the project management plan may actually encompass the main components of the RMP, so it may not be necessary to have a separate document. Who endorses the RMP? Typically each of the team leaders in the application lifecycle. Who participates in the process? Subject matter experts are people who are going to help define and specify requirements. TBAs will gather, analyze, document the requirements. The designers and developers will design and develop the solution components from the requirements that BAs have elicited. The testers then take those requirements and test them to help ensure they still fit the purpose and satisfy the original requirements. Finally, the change management analyst reviews and implements changes to the organization based on the requirements.

The project manager can use requirements to provide meaningful reporting on the status of the project using the metrics that we keep talking about - things like how many requirements are still yet to be approved or outstanding to be approved by stakeholders; how many requirements are deferred which are going to potentially change the scope; and critically, what the impacts are on the project.

So there are a lot of people interested in requirements and they all have a slightly different view so we need to make sure upfront that we consult with each of those people. The RMP is the mechanism to engage so we understand what they need and keep them engaged throughout the entire project.

Use a RACI matrix, if possible, to show the stakeholder their role in requirements, their interest, and when in the process they are typically involved. Identifying the stakeholders helps define and verify the requirements management process.

# Requirements Management Process
Identify stakeholders

Gather/elicit requirements

Analyze requirements

Specify/document requirements

Baseline requirement groups (verify, validate, and prioritize requirements- i.e.: agree and sign-off on requirements)

Communicate requirements

Monitor/track requirements

Manage and control changes to requirements

Report requirements compliance

The process is a really important part of the requirements management plan. You need to have a process that pulls together the steps: identify stakeholders; solicit the requirements; analyze the requirements; document requirements; baseline;, communicate; monitor and track; manage and control; and report. The process is important because you want it to be repeatable, so that a change of the requirements does not want initiate a different process.

It is important to document and articulate the process so that everybody who has an interest in requirements change complies. It should also link in nicely to the project change management control. Naturally, this would link directly into your issues register and that is where you would hook into your lower level requirements process. It is important that those two controls mesh together on any project.

#  Requirements Types
Requirement types are a mechanism to enable a cascading hierarchy of requirements. 
This allows the initial broad coverage of requirements with a business focus to be traced to detailed requirements with a technical focus.

# Requirement Attributes
The following requirement attributes should be captured for all requirements:

Requirement identifier (unique)
Requirement name
Requirement description
Requirement version number
Requirement type
Requirement change history
Requirement status
Requirement priority
Requirement owner
Requirement trace information
Requirement process/activity reference
